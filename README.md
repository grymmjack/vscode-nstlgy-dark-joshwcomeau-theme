# vscode-nstlgy-dark-joshwcomeau-theme README

This theme was converted using OpenAI o3 from a zed theme to vscode theme.

The source zed theme was [nstlgy-dark](https://github.com/nstlgy/zed-nstlgy-dark).
It was inspired by [Josh W. Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) blog and tutorial code editor theme.
